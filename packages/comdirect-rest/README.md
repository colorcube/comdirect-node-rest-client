# Comdirect REST API Client Lib for Node/Typescript

This is an unofficial node.js module for the [comdirect REST API](https://www.comdirect.de/cms/kontakt-zugaenge-api.html)

**Important: This is not very much tested**

Feel free to clone this and make it a real library, as this is a quick and dirty solution. I won't work on this very much.
